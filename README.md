## Development Notes

- All API operations (CRUD) are handled in-memory via `taskStore.ts`
- No database or persistent backend â€” suitable for demos or enhancements
- SSR-safe design â€” resolves hydration issues

---

## Future Improvements

- Persistent backend (e.g., Supabase, MongoDB)
- Auth support (NextAuth.js)
- Real-time sync with websockets
- Tagging and project-level grouping

## Recipes Route (`/recipies`)

This route is added to demonstrate integration with an external API.

### Endpoint

```
GET /recipies
```

### Description

Fetches a list of recipe data from an external API and renders it within the app. This is useful for demonstrating:

- External API consumption using Next.js
- Server-side fetching and rendering
- Custom pages outside of the core task manager

### Example Usage

Visit [http://localhost:3000/recipies](http://localhost:3000/recipies) in your browser to explore sample recipes.
